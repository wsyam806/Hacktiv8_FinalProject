This study presents an exploratory analysis of banking data to uncover potential insights and patterns related to customer behavior, credit risk assessment, geographic influences, customer segmentations, and time series trends. The analysis is conducted by integrating multiple tables containing transaction records, customer demographics, and district characteristics. The study employs various analytical techniques to extract valuable information from the data.

In the realm of Customer Behavior Analysis, the study investigates transaction frequency patterns among different account types, distinguishing between owners and users. Additionally, the research delves into the average transaction amounts and account balances across distinct demographic regions. The analysis further dissects transaction types, such as credit and debit, based on customer attributes, uncovering trends and correlations between demographics and transaction behaviors.

Credit Risk Assessment is another focal point, wherein the study evaluates the intricate connection between client demographics and their credit activities. Notably, the study scrutinizes credit utilization ratios among diverse demographic groups and explores the relationship between unemployment rates and loan default rates. By employing these insights, the study contributes to the enhancement of credit risk assessment strategies.

Geographic Analysis explores the interplay between district characteristics and banking activities. The study investigates how features like district population and urban ratio influence banking behaviors, yielding valuable insights into regional banking dynamics.

Time Series Analysis forms an essential component of this study, unraveling transaction trends and patterns over time. The study identifies peak transaction periods and explores any seasonality in transaction frequencies or amounts. By uncovering temporal trends, the research contributes to proactive decision-making for resource allocation and customer service enhancements.

Furthermore, the study employs advanced techniques such as Customer Segmentations, wherein clustering algorithms are utilized to group customers based on transaction behaviors and demographic attributes. These segments provide a deeper understanding of customer profiles and enable tailored services. The identification of high-value customers based on criteria such as average salary, transaction volume, and account types is an integral part of this analysis.
